The calculations are done in the .ipynb files, while the .jl files contain functions. The main script is called "main script", while "main script - pseudodata" contains a version of the main script that generates pseudodata and makes the same calculations as the main script, but on pseudodata instead of real data. If you plan on running the notebooks, make sure to change the path variables (for saving figures) or delete the "savefig" commands.
